# 🗳️ Full-Stack Voting System

A modern, secure, and easy-to-use **Voting System** for digital elections — built with a **FastAPI backend** and a **React frontend** (or your preferred frontend framework). This platform is ideal for use in schools, organizations, cooperatives, or any group that requires secure and transparent voting.

## 📌 Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that allows registered users to vote for candidates in a secure and authenticated way. It supports admin functionality for managing elections, candidates, and viewing results.

The system is divided into:

- **Backend**: FastAPI-based REST API with MongoDB for storing users, candidates, and votes
- **Frontend**: (e.g., React/Next.js) for a clean and responsive user interface
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL) for flexible document-based data modeling
